## Coding Standards

### PHP Standards

- Follow PSR-12 coding standards
- Use type hints and return types where possible
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add PHPDoc comments for public methods
- Keep methods focused on single responsibilities

### JavaScript Standards

- Use modern ES6+ syntax
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Add comments for complex logic
- Handle errors gracefully

### CSS Standards

- Use consistent naming conventions (BEM preferred)
- Keep specificity low
- Use CSS custom properties for theming
- Ensure responsive design

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Testing
- `chore`: Maintenance

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
composer test

# Run specific test file
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/MapTest.php

# Run with coverage
./vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-html coverage/
```

### Writing Tests

- Place test files in `tests/` directory
- Name test files with `Test.php` suffix
- Use descriptive test method names
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Test both success and failure scenarios

Example:

```php
/** @test */
public function it_creates_map_with_valid_data()
{
    // Arrange
    $data = ['name' => 'test', 'title' => 'Test Map'];

    // Act
    $map = Map::create($data);

    // Assert
    $this->assertEquals('test', $map->name);
    $this->assertDatabaseHas('wmng_maps', $data);
}
```
